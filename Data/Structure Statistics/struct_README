The program collects data for BARW system statistics against 'N_0' and 'b'.
No cellular competition happens here, everything concerns branches random walking in 3D space.
Collected across only 2000 runs, which include total branch death.

The lines in the data files read as follows:

Tip generation size: 'N_0'
Branching rate: 'b'
  Average...
Number of living branches
Number of annihilations
Number of total branches, including "parents" and annihilated branches.
Number of terminal branches, which excludes parent branches. All "dead ends".
Total death probability

Note that the number of total branches is equal to 2(terminal)-1
and number of annihilations is equal to terminal - living.
