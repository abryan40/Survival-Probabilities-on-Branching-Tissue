Data files contain the two-point orientational correlation along a single "phantom" (without collisions) branch evolved for 3000 generations and averaged over 100 simulation runs. The correlation values are listed in order of increasing distance "s" between the two segements of the branch between which we are comparing the orientation. The values of "s", in units of cell diameter, are s=1,2,3,...
