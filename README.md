# Survival-Probabilities-on-Branching-Tissue
Simulation code and raw data for "Survival in Branching Cellular Populations" by A. S. Bryant and M. O. Lavrentovich from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

The code and data directory files are described as follows:

## Code

*.h : header files necessary to compile the programs
	
Perlen.cpp : generates a file with orientational correlations for the persistence length calculations. a single branch without collisions is simulated
	
BARW_bt.cpp : statistics calculations for branched structures as a function of time. Generates raw data file of time-dependent data.
	
BARW_bs_nd.cpp : Phase diagram generation for survival probability as a function of selective advantage s and branching rate b. Only structures which do not completely die out are considered.
	
BARW_Nb.cpp : Phase diagram generation for various branching structure characteristics (number of actively dividing branches, number of terminal branches, etc.) as a function of branch population size N_0 and branching rate b. Generates raw data file.
	
modelplot.cpp : Generates a VTK file for a single simulation run of a branched structure. Can be used to visualize the branched structures.
	
Any of the "*.cpp" files may be compiled via:   g++ -std=c++11 -ggdb -O3 -pthread -o PROGRAM_NAME
The generated programs require no inputs, so the individual *.cpp files have to be edited in order to change parameters of the simulation.
	
Check the individual ".cpp" files for additional comments on how to set parameters of the simulation.

## Data

This directory contains subdirectories containing all raw data analyzed in the project. Each subdirectory contains a README describing the format of the raw data.
	
## Branching structure visualization

To visualize the branching structures, the "modelplot.cpp" code has to be compiled, with appropriate choices of parameters within the file (see comments in the code). Running the compiled program will generate a VTK file which can be opened via Paraview (https://www.paraview.org/download/) for visualization of the structure. The VTK file may be read in via the "Particles Reader" in ParaView. The repository contains an "EXAMPLE.vtk" structure file generated by the simulation. Here is the example structure:
