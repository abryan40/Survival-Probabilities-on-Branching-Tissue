# Survival-Probabilities-on-Branching-Tissue
Simulation code and raw data for [*Survival in Branching Cellular Populations*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04992) by A. S. Bryant and M. O. Lavrentovich from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville

The code and data directory files are described below.

## Code Directory

The contents have all of the necessary C++ code to generate the raw data and structure visualizations of the branching simulations. Different programs correspond to different data types produced:

*X.h* : Header files necessary to compile the programs
	
*Perlen.cpp* : Generates a file with orientational correlations for the persistence length calculations. A single branch without collisions is simulated.
	
*BARW_bt.cpp* : Statistics calculations for branched structures as a function of time. Generates raw data file of time-dependent data.
	
*BARW_bs_nd.cpp* : Phase diagram generation for survival probability and other probabilities related to evolutionary dynamics of a mutant as a function of selective advantage *s* and branching rate *b*. Only structures which do not completely die out are considered.
	
*BARW_Nb.cpp* : Phase diagram generation for various branching structure characteristics (number of actively dividing branches, number of terminal branches, etc.) as a function of branch population size *N<sup>0</sup>* and branching rate *b*. Generates raw data file.
	
*modelplot.cpp* : Generates a VTK file for a single simulation run of a branched structure. Can be used to visualize the branched structures.
	
Any of the *X.cpp* files may be compiled via:   
	`g++ -std=c++11 -ggdb -O3 -pthread -o PROGRAM_NAME`

The generated programs require no inputs, so the individual *.cpp* files have to be edited in order to change parameters of the simulation.
	
Check the individual *.cpp* files for additional comments on how to set parameters of the simulation.

## Data

This directory contains subdirectories containing all raw data analyzed in the project. Each subdirectory contains a README describing the format of the raw data. These data were produced using the code in the Code directory.
	
## Branching structure visualization

To visualize the branching structures, the *modelplot.cpp* code has to be compiled, with appropriate choices of parameters within the file (see comments in the code). Running the compiled program will generate a VTK file which can be opened via [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) for visualization of the structure. The VTK file may be read in via the *Particles Reader* in ParaView. The repository contains an *EXAMPLE.vtk* structure file generated by the simulation which can be opened with ParaView as described. Here is the example structure:
