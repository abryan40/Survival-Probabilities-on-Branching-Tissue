Each line in the datafiles contains the following:

Selective bias: 's'
Branching rate: 'b'
  Average...
Survival probability: Psurv
Percentage of mutant cells relative to the total frontier population size.
Fixation probability: Pfix
Time to fixation: (generation)
Extinction probability: Pext
Time to extinction: (generation)
Steady state (no intercellular competition) probability: Psts
Time to steady state: (generation)
Total number of accepted runs* 

* Given that total death runs are thrown out, some hard limit on the number of attempts has a chance
to result in accepted runs less than the ideal. For all of the datafiles listed, it is 2000, but the
program is capable of averaging over an "incomplete" number of runs, which may be useful at large N_0.
