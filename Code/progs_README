The data in the paper was generated using self-authored C++ programs, the origins for which began in the summer of 2018.

Much of each header or .cpp file is the same, with few differences which may change parameters of interest being collected
or culling unnecessary processes for optimization. Each program may contain remnants of past iterations or the files they
were derived from. The "modelplot" program for instance runs on a single thread to generate a single model because the
statistics files use multi-threading to shorten computation time.

The matrix.h file is a self-defined header containing certain 3 vector and 3x3 vector functions.

Each file was compiled with the following flags:

g++ -std=c++11 -ggdb -O3 -pthread -o ...

All of the parameter changes were hard-coded such that the programs could be run on a cluster with no user input.
